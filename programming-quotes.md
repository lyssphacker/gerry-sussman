Creating a little language to solve a specific problem is the most effective technique yet devised for reducing complexity in software. ... For this reason, little languages work best in concert. The ideal technique for writing a complex program is to slice it into multiple problem-specific pieces and then define a language for each problem slice. If we slice the program vertically, the result is a “tower” of languages, layered atop one another. Regardless of how we slice the overall problem, we can use the right language, and the right paradigm, for each subproblem.
