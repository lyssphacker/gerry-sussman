Abstract

Most systems we build work well for the application that they were designed for, but they are brittle in that adapting to even small changes in the problem requires large changes in the code.  Can we optimize for flexibility, trading off other virtues like proofs of correctness or efficient execution?  I think this is often the right path.

Indeed, Postel's Law, "Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others," is strong advice for enhancing robustness in open systems.

In the spring term I teach an advanced programming class, where the goal is to learn how to avoid programming oneself into a corner.  One of the most powerful (and dangerous) techniques for enhancing flexibility is the use of extensible generic operations.

I will show where it is to our advantage to make systems with extensible generic operations, and how to control such systems.
