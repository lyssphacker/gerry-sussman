0:00I a PowerPoint so either like essays
0:05which we have fun printed out she's a
0:09proposal that I've been asked to write
0:13for in staff this summer in fact the
0:16reason I'm here is that proposal got
0:19funded against all odds you will see why
0:22if you read it and so we're prospecting
0:26around for smart interesting people who
0:31might want to help us do this project
0:33the large project two million dollars a
0:36year for five years in the staff balk at
0:41two million they only come to 1 billion
0:44America five years but management plan
0:46together billion so we're really going
0:48to do it as I go through this thing
0:52you'll see that this proposal is
0:53somewhat far-fetched way it happened is
0:58that we talked about this my research
1:02groups off and on for decades always
1:09something else to do and about a year
1:16ago or so two things happened one was
1:20that Peter Freeman was starting to find
1:23the genie reinvention of the Internet I
1:26got has to be a little bit committees to
1:30talk about it and remember sitting there
1:32they can JS the internet actually was
1:36the probably the best thing that my
1:38research community did in the seventies
1:41and we're going to reinvent do anything
1:46should be program and so I started
1:49thinking will hire about that and
1:52realize that would be often difficult
1:57since they've sort of been embedded in
2:01pretty much the same paradox or pretty
2:07much as long as I get
2:08the ball with that system might take
2:12simula as first appearing 64 five or so
2:16then the stuff that we're doing today
2:20not only all too familiar except for the
2:25networking a lot of the best people in
2:29the 60s would think what most people are
2:31good things from the veteran in any case
2:36is extremely recognizable and so once
2:42you've been embedded in something for
2:44that many decades it actually sets up a
2:47sense of normality have the sense of
2:51what's normal this isn't normal doing
2:55this a long is actually part I think
2:57we'll be learning lots so the other
3:01thing that happened is that one of
3:03researchers in our research institute
3:07ampm Arctic who has been interested in
3:13sort of now kind of distant topic
3:16bootstrapping with nothing for the last
3:22which years actually started showing
3:25some real progress on his latest system
3:27of that hour ago and as you as I move it
3:30into what this proposal is all about
3:33which is basically to take a very large
3:37computer experience and do the entire
3:39thing user code one of the things that
3:45everybody here's my language news off up
3:48a lot of those lines of codes and
3:50thought and so you have to have some
3:53strategy to deal with issues a lot to
3:58user 8002 ten thousand four lines of
4:04code I wish me happy
4:10do this can't extend to hundreds
4:15actually works and so I guess the other
4:22introductory mark here is that my first
4:27prepared this particular top and gave a
4:30version of the month so I realized that
4:35my usual approach which is usually
4:38critical that is a lot of things that I
4:42do that most people because they ate
4:44something somebody else is done
4:47something happened and I realized that
4:51informed criticism has been completely
4:53been done in by left because the web has
4:58begins so much unformed uninformed
5:02criticism this kind of regressions law
5:04that provides good money out of
5:07circulation bad criticism has given good
5:10criticism house which we just can't
5:12criticize doesn't matter what's behind
5:16it and so I've changed my tune and try
5:21to shift over to asking questions rather
5:24than Grand Princess this talk will be
5:29successful if i can get you read that
5:32paper and get some of you contact me so
5:37had to rewrite the story but i think
5:41it's a good story about our profession
5:43all of our produce without it close but
5:48of course in the original stories the
5:49kid declared the thing after we had
5:52closed now doesn't
6:00and it's interesting that my neighbors
6:05who are not computer scientists just
6:08have questions like this if they ask all
6:11of the time and try and think of
6:19something reasonable to tell why does it
6:24take one why is New of us my wife just
6:28got huge top-of-the-line halibut would
6:34be just of everything the lamb slower
6:37than the moment she had discovered
6:39because there's even though the this
6:42drive on it is larger she got the
6:44largest one and they're still wasn't
6:46enough room for all the fashion the
6:48system is doing to make it appear as
6:50though sisterhood event in some way in
6:54fact persistent is unbelievably
6:57application if you need one is the
6:59console disk space just to get five plus
7:01that's true Microsoft step no that was
7:05places are after an update why do I have
7:10to reboot my chain that's a really good
7:12question because you think that things
7:16would be more likely down yeah I can do
7:23wittingly authoring than microsoft word
7:25which is visually done back and set
7:27before but for somebody's I can't do it
7:30in a blog wiki a which gained much after
7:36and in fact I can't even really do much
7:41authoring in this most useful browser
7:46then even though hypercard was already
7:48eight or nine years old but he wants
7:52what happened why didn't something
7:58into the ground service that instead of
8:01JavaScript infants feel so I think
8:07everybody here needs the answer to those
8:09questions I hope you do you don't talk
8:13to me later I have my own versions of
8:18these questions so pretty much any of
8:22the computers we have today as pretty
8:26much what the total computing and
8:28storage capacity of the entire internet
8:31was down 1986 or so cinders think trying
8:35to figure out exactly and but the
8:38internet already have zillions of those
8:39it was already going and working quite
8:43well in the mid 80s it was very simple
8:46then it's very simple now but what
8:50happened what's inside when I look
8:52inside the PC or Mac announcing anything
8:56this lucky I didn't see any scalable
8:58architecture and you are to expect to
9:00see thousands of veterans then fact
9:04talking to my friends at Microsoft they
9:07said verily those windows XP of a
9:10network 20 processes yeah because the
9:17Internet has been able to scale by 12
9:20orders and equity but it must complete
9:23few reason as the system's person
9:25milliken Restless careful Phillip
9:27interests of how the system software on
9:31these computers hasn't scalable ask
9:35especially since you can throw away the
9:38operating system essentially just get
9:42good yeah you have operates as an escape
9:48and etc etc as i did a little
9:56calculation here having a lot of it
10:02books i have a collection of
10:05encyclopedia botanica's and the favor is
10:07the 14th edition the classic one as each
10:14volume is about a thousand inches long
10:16its domination at that pretty much okay
10:21yeah if you stack those up you can sort
10:23of being for yourself one of them
10:26thousand volumes of thousand things easy
10:29so many pages of so many lines of text
10:32and actually if you start county lines
10:36of code in this the operating system
10:40windows application so far to get to a
10:43quite a few wanted to code probably more
10:46than this comparison is completely
10:52unfair so I put apples they're down here
10:54is this system i'm using the difference
10:56presentation which also is its own
10:58operating system that was its own
11:01operating system jacket Xerox PARC and
11:06everything they need I'm here is being
11:09done by the system were not even any
11:12windows code at all sockets everything
11:19and it's about 230,000 listen up and
11:29yeah so just to prove that
11:46that's actually if everything is dynamic
11:50and alive no modes of humanity it's kind
11:56of what we were thinking about it's one
12:03of the things that we've done over the
12:05years squeak is only about 10 your fault
12:07it's just this small populace we feared
12:10Java wasn't going to really be
12:11compatible across machines back then
12:15because it was you standing the test
12:22sequence that was in every which way we
12:30used to do is to take an actual model of
12:34the virtual machine 1 p-5 kathleen
12:37wright the translator to translate and
12:40separate present so this system I'm not
12:45strolling the virtues of the system's
12:46old obsolete system reaches high point
12:501978 yourself but this system does run
12:54bit identically doesn't and if you're
12:58going to be on the internet because
13:05otherwise who knows so thinking about
13:12the functionality here we did a little
13:16test and indicated that pretty much all
13:19of the time loneliness 100,000 lines of
13:21it and we started wondering about well
13:24how small could you make it if you
13:25didn't do it in 1970 small-time like
13:29what if you actually tried to use some
13:31higher-level I to people and various
13:37handle is goddess family about the
13:39interest in machine fortunate for twenty
13:41thousand five of course we never
13:44intended that we're going to do this
13:46because who would fund this
13:48nobody today it might even be hard to
13:52argue sixes but without twenty thousand
13:59lines of totally pretty nice because
14:01that's about 400 cook boy one book is
14:04different than an encyclopedia and one
14:07encyclopedias that's because our brains
14:11don't scale the only way we can scale
14:15things is life i sighs but by
14:17abstraction everybody knows that there's
14:20nothing in this office to say and then
14:26we thought for 20,000 minds code that
14:30would be really interesting what if you
14:32could also explain it you wind up with
14:34something about the size of my book so
14:38it's actually milking computing and this
14:44book is one of the great books of all
14:45time we cannot have an equivalent book
14:47get really a chain one of the reasons is
14:51that biologists are incredibly fortunate
14:55in that nature has already presented
14:58them with living things and what they
15:01spend virtually all their time thinking
15:03about is how those things work all the
15:06different other ways you can clip clicks
15:09so all I have to do is mail it get a
15:13couple of geniuses to write five or six
15:16editions of this book and get this
15:17masterpiece look doesn't even require
15:21you to know anything about chemistry
15:22start meeting just open it up start
15:27media and just issue along you know a
15:30lot about molecular biology it's not a
15:34light book just so we started thinking
15:39about that and I wrote a white paper as
15:43I usually do just to try and think it
15:45through never finish these white papers
15:50I hand them out to everybody and what
15:56amazing thing happens the summer in SF
15:59called me up and asked me to collagen
16:00trying to enough like hoes I still don't
16:05know exactly why this is back really the
16:08company team because there's a high
16:11probability of failure fact the
16:14difficulty with the viewers have is that
16:18you'll notice when you read it it
16:20actually has sections in there who say
16:22we don't do on this part that must be
16:27okay along time ago because that's what
16:30research the difference doing research
16:32and engineering engineering you're
16:34supposed to get that jet engine working
16:36and not have including pause sky whereas
16:39the search he kind of wanted to fall out
16:42of the sky and some interesting but so
16:53then they surprised us by funding it and
16:58this is part of our kind of Grand
17:01Challenges list if you think people
17:03should be one of the most interesting
17:06things that I do it again everybody in
17:09this month this talk is so full of
17:11cliches I can't stand it but you know
17:15there just hasn't been a Moore's law and
17:16software just incredible yes it has its
17:23culture progressively slower yeah
17:25probably endures more maybe
17:27inverse-square force so that's an
17:33interesting one think about what what
17:35would it be to do something that's
17:38around two orders of magnitude target
17:41imaginative interoperability I just
17:48can't believe whoops prison would be
17:52great if he had and I've always been
17:57pissed off that the vendors aimed
18:00personal computing sit at business where
18:05we having least invite at least
18:07interested and users most boring people
18:12different and course it's important but
18:18it's really bad because the people who
18:20shouldn't join in our field and should
18:23be having fun they don't see fun that we
18:30realize now we've been analyzing
18:34english-language long suffice thing
18:37actually is an Asian operator so unbe
18:43instead of fun you're talking to people
18:47who don't know why the stuff is done in
18:50the first place and these last two I
18:53won't bother explaining with the bar
18:58they're really critical one of one of
19:01the things some of us old people decided
19:04to do is to take
19:05hours in their own hands and primed a
19:10different so meager potty and I'm a
19:12better teacher besides of you time to go
19:15laptop just by God to it on the grounds
19:19that all the laptops are made in Taiwan
19:23anyway the world's largest laptopping
19:26factors elantra exported three percent
19:29of all the laptops in the world with all
19:31of the human factors all of the bills
19:34most of the Sony's and half Macintosh
19:38have a different factory I also make
19:42this place Nicholas talk to the CEO of
19:47pon de Bruijn following wonderful
19:50proposition which involved showing this
19:56guy how many hits the hundred-dollar
19:59laptop is getting on Google how few hits
20:03this guy was getting on google and so
20:08wonderful end of the story was that
20:10vomiting tsk I agree to build this
20:12development actually put in substantial
20:16amount of funding I'll do that putting
20:20enough funding to do give markable
20:22swales she is over less than two years
20:26since this project started and the first
20:30thousand factory built machines just the
20:32period last week I came within a couple
20:35of days of the unity of this talk on
20:37this issue on and in order to do a real
20:43computer for cost of a little over and
20:48the dollars welcome children and solve
20:50displayed on the CTO one laptop child
20:56something is a extremely talented lady
21:02scientist who used to vote for Intel
21:04those specialists who displays and she
21:09was she had the guts to actually design
21:11and really invent a new kind of flat
21:14screen display as hard as I could have
21:17and this display have takes 17 to the
21:23power of a malignant display and cost
21:28113 supplied with 900 x 1200 resolution
21:33pasta just about $39 so it can be used
21:39in the sunlight also back so it's a good
21:45thank you just shows that 15 or 20
21:50people who are determined can do pretty
21:52much and you can hope i hope that
21:55Nicholas gets the nobel peace prize they
21:59will manifest this thing out of almonds
22:01method I'm going to get buyers between
22:04funders with the project get builders
22:08for the thing is actually happening but
22:11of course a children's computer is not
22:13the hardware this the experience on it
22:17and add a different matter entirely
22:21particularly ones going through don't
22:25leave that side so these are things that
22:30affected me deeply when I was younger
22:34and essentially this project is looking
22:41at physicist with envy and saying please
22:46every time you physicists do something
22:49that starts out messy and then they want
22:51you up inventing some mathematics it
22:52takes a really pretty it usually fits in
22:56for an iphone and if this is what I feel
23:00you can actually notice things about it
23:03that are hard to notice if it's 10 or 15
23:06pages long of certain asymmetries
23:09between the electric and magnetic field
23:12attracted Einsteins attention probably
23:15shouldn't been here and this is my Bible
23:21when I was a biologist and I
23:25particularly like this
23:30this is the constitution of the US and I
23:35think about it's the colonel so you
23:37think it was a better program but it's
23:40the kernel of an operating system that's
23:41been running with millions of not
23:44terribly cooperative parts in us for
23:48hundreds of years and hasn't ruckus
23:49think about it meta ideas here I had to
23:55be small in order for them to work those
23:59guys really knew what they were doing an
24:01astoundingly everybody who worked on the
24:04Constitution United States ramp is
24:06actually vegetated hear something I've
24:11never even possible yeah so I started in
24:17graduate school Ivan Sutherland had
24:20already done sketch pad which used the
24:23kind of a field idea which I'll get to
24:25in a little bit and the big topic of
24:28conversation 40 years ago was the
24:33ARPANET which hadn't been done yet and
24:35look lighter the sky called at the
24:40intergalactic network even in his
24:44reports to the military and the reason
24:47to use that term is that he was
24:50convinced that networking was bad in the
24:5360s because people weren't thinking big
24:55enough they were always trying to solve
24:57little problems particularly vendors
24:59like IBM and the vendors were trying to
25:04build perfect little machines that were
25:09half duplex rather than full duplex and
25:11so forth and when i started in graduate
25:14school the publication's of simula in
25:18this country had just come out a few
25:20months earlier and it turned out all
25:25three of these things were abstractly
25:28similar this had a thing that wasn't
25:33called objects in it but that was the
25:35way the graphic system was organized
25:37this had separate things that were
25:40supposed to cooperate in some form by
25:42sending messages
25:43this was designed for huge oil
25:46refineries and Norwegian shipbuilding
25:48and my background was at a math major
25:52and a biology major and these things
25:56just all looked very very similar they
25:59look like a network of computer like
26:05things just sending messages rat and
26:10didn't the other whether it was hardware
26:11or software and I thought boy we have a
26:17hundred trillion cells in our body and
26:19it only took 40 cell divisions in order
26:23to make us actually takes 50 but 10 of
26:29those cell divisions are actually used
26:30up in debugging in destroying cells one
26:35of the nicer things that nature has has
26:38given us so this became kind of a mental
26:41image for the systems and pretty much
26:47everybody in the ARPA community also
26:51felt the same way and there's also a
26:55computer done by this guy a Barton that
27:01was had the structure in it this
27:06computer that be 5000 had seven for my
27:09money had seven out of the 10 best ideas
27:11ever done in software put in the
27:13hardware of the machine designed in 1961
27:17happened to be by luck the third machine
27:20I ever had to learn and it's be quite
27:23recognizable to people today because
27:24every bite encoded vm on the planet is a
27:29software version of what this machine
27:30executed directly alright so this was
27:35the first computer and almost the only
27:37computer where the designer of that said
27:40you know people are going to write in
27:41higher-level languages so let us make a
27:45piece of hardware that will optimize
27:47that instead of think about what we have
27:51today we have everybody trying to write
27:53in higher-level languages and yet
27:56have to emulate the hardware environment
27:58there should be running in because the
28:03computer chip vendors refuse to learn
28:07anything about software so I think I
28:10mean just think about how out of whack
28:12this is and the other book I carry
28:22around is this because bottom half of
28:29page 13 had the other part of the
28:33question so if objects are the way to
28:35organize things how do you organize the
28:38methods and in other ways of thinking
28:41about it is to think about it in the
28:43self-referential way that mccarthy
28:46arrived at and of course there are
28:48zillions of universal turing machines
28:50before McCarthy did this the interesting
28:52thing about what McCarthy did was it was
28:56the first time anybody had done a Turing
28:57machine that had slope to it it was not
29:00just universal but it was actually
29:02within some short Hamming distance of
29:06whole bunches of interesting
29:08computations and yet it was still small
29:12so that says something injured so I've
29:15always thought about this is the math
29:16Maxwell's equations of programming right
29:20and of course what what we need now is
29:22the relativistic equations for
29:24programming whatever that means so so
29:33the other thing about the ARPA community
29:36was it had big ideas it wasn't just the
29:41group of us we were part of the r /
29:43community but we were by no means who
29:46wound up getting the better books
29:48written about us but in fact the ARPA
29:51community itself thirsted after this
29:56notion of being able to provide people
29:59with a kind of an amplification of their
30:01intellect an amplification of their
30:03intellectual reach both in time and
30:07space
30:09in ideas and so forth and so this whole
30:14community cooperated talk with each
30:16other very well and one of the key parts
30:20of it was this early work station or
30:25first work station called the Alto which
30:29among besides having the screen on it it
30:32was about fifty to a hundred times
30:34faster than you could get on time
30:36sharing so all of a sudden when you sat
30:39down to this machine you're sitting down
30:41to something it was a bit like a
30:42supercomputer and immediately you found
30:47that there are a zillion things you
30:48could do without optimization so you can
30:51go out and drink a pitcher of beer at
30:53lunch and do five or six complete
30:55experiments before suppertime because
31:00you had this machine and you didn't have
31:01to optimize you can just throw the code
31:03away you write these short little
31:05snippets of code and since most ideas
31:09are mediocre down to bad whole idea is
31:13to be able to have lots of ideas and get
31:15rid of most of them so this is a perfect
31:19setup for that and it's interesting to
31:22look at the specs here so o'clock speed
31:29today is x 75 bandwidth is x 150 11,000
31:35larger main memory disk is out of sight
31:38tenth the price but if you look at
31:42moore's law that's 23 doublings since
31:46then so that is a factor of 8 million
31:49and you know no matter how you twist and
31:52turn this you can't find eight million
31:54in there something is not scaling and my
32:01favorite guy to be critical is Butler so
32:09he has the heart
32:10just thing I'm usually I've usually been
32:13the harshest but I could only the
32:15benchmarks that we did a show about a
32:17factor of 600 has been lost and Butler
32:21has pretty good figures that show a full
32:23factor of a thousand I think about that
32:26that's ten doublings right and the
32:30doublings happen every year and a half
32:33right so that means 15 years has been
32:36lost because of bad architecture and so
32:41there's this myth that says don't do
32:44special-purpose hardware because moore's
32:46law will always overtake the special
32:49purpose hardware little it's not
32:51even close actually what's happened is
32:55we've lost the factor of a thousand in
32:57efficiency because we can't run a code
33:01the way we want to what it needs to be
33:03right that's a really interesting figure
33:07to go go back and look at so another
33:12thing we tried to do at park I'm not
33:15going to dwell on much here but we just
33:18noticed that the thing that was most
33:19like the user interfaces of the 60s was
33:22a nuclear power thing or maybe a nuclear
33:26submarine thing where it takes 20 people
33:28to run the application on it and in
33:33personal computing you really can't have
33:34that you really need to have something
33:37that's explorable undoable something and
33:40where the main thing you're trying to do
33:43is not so much functionality but
33:44learnability basically taking the idea
33:46that is there is going to be progress
33:48then you have to somehow build in
33:52learning into the thing because no great
33:55idea that is put on a computer that is
33:58not learnable is a great idea I ain't
34:02there so we saw this as a huge switch
34:07and without trying to be critical about
34:10today i would say today's user
34:11interfaces even on the park models are
34:14way too much like this people actually
34:17take training courses
34:20for them so so one of things we thought
34:28that would be neat if we did this
34:30project since it would be so small it
34:33would be interesting to try and think of
34:35it also as a museum on itself what would
34:38that mean so it wouldn't just be
34:40reflective but it would actually be
34:42introspective so it would actually not
34:45just be a model of computation but it
34:47would actually have a model of itself
34:48and so that suggests a come a rather
34:52different kind of user interface get to
34:56be designed so I think architecture is
35:03the key here again I'm not saying
35:05anything people don't know and I'll just
35:09put up three pictures here most software
35:13today feels like this to me because once
35:17software gets beyond a certain size you
35:19can only add around the edges right it
35:21grows by accretion you can't really do
35:24much of anything else and over here we
35:29have something that nobody in computing
35:30knows how to do what I call real
35:32engineering empire state building was
35:34built by less than 3,000 people in less
35:36than a year they had to demolish the old
35:39Waldorf Astoria Hotel in order to do it
35:41steel arrived from Pittsburgh still 110
35:45degrees hot and the framing went up at
35:49the rate of two floors a day each for
35:51the Empire State Building had a narrow
35:53gauge railroad on it and it had three
35:55times as many elevators going up the
35:57side just to get stuff up there than the
36:00mint and the building has today as one
36:03of the great building jobs and anybody
36:05who has pretensions to be an engineer
36:07should get any of the four or five
36:09marvelous books including a Foreman's
36:12notebook which has been reproduced in
36:14facsimile that had little snapshots that
36:17this guy had taken in the old Pike a
36:21typewriter talking about what was going
36:25on so I claim that nobody in computing
36:29knows how to organize 3,000 people to do
36:31something really big and get
36:33done in a year so whatever software
36:36engineering is it isn't anything like
36:38modern engineering software engineering
36:42is more like that like architecture
36:45before they were arches I think the best
36:48practice is rather more towards the
36:51pyramid you could call this a form of
36:54dynamic object oriented programming or
36:56pick your favorite architectural thing
36:59that just isn't brick like and yeah you
37:01can build big structures that are the
37:04size of this thing with one millionth
37:06amount of materials but if you think
37:09about how primitive the best stuff
37:12that's done today is it's appalling so
37:24my favorite Don quote here is beware of
37:31bugs in the above code I've only proved
37:32the correct not tried it and so what we
37:36have is a new kind of mathematics by old
37:39math is tiny little theorems that have
37:42an infinite number of instances and what
37:49we do in computing is things that are
37:53finite but huge due to beyond the worst
37:57nightmares of any mathematician and so
38:00we don't get to prove anything
38:02interesting piece to my theoretical
38:06friends but essentially proving
38:10something as np-hard is not interesting
38:13because you can still build it build
38:16anything you want so the real question
38:18is how can you build it and debug it and
38:22this is what makes this talk difficult
38:25because I'm used to giving talks about
38:28stuff that we've already done here's an
38:31analogy that won't play the Tacoma
38:34Narrows movie but I love this movie but
38:37everybody here has seen this movie and a
38:39number of times it's just the great
38:41movie it's wonderful that the person who
38:45predicted
38:46but the bridge was going to go down had
38:48predicted it more than six months ahead
38:50of time and had predicted more or less
38:55the magnitude of the wind the wind that
38:58nobody thought would ever happen 95 to
39:00100 miles an hour and so six months or
39:03so later they were measuring a 95 mile
39:07an hour wind in the Tacoma Narrows and
39:11so they actually went to the camera
39:13store as this is online you can go to
39:16the website of the camera story that
39:18they got the movie cameras and they just
39:19set the movie cameras up at the end of
39:21the bridge turn them on and just let the
39:24whole thing happen that's so great but
39:31so to me computer science is a science
39:36that requires an artifact to be made so
39:39this project is partly to make an
39:41artifact that is can be actually studied
39:43the problem is 100 million lines of code
39:45can't really be studied so you have to
39:49make something that's actually study a
39:50bull but it has to be big enough to be
39:53interesting so we decided to take
39:58something that we understood and just
40:00try in like this chain of being up here
40:06from tiny little building blocks to more
40:09and more complex architectures of things
40:17so this is at least my favorite slide
40:20and sinner in my lifetime people were
40:26right around this is Linus I was born
40:29when Linus Pauling did his book on the
40:32chemical bond in 1940 and I was 13 when
40:37Watson and Crick did DNA and we're now
40:43up to still thinking there might be a
40:48miracle or two in a intelligent behavior
40:52but all the ones before hand have turned
40:56out to be architectures of things so
41:01for this system we've got basically
41:05something that goes from the power
41:06supply up to the end user and we really
41:10have to do all of these things then
41:14we're going to leave some of the logic
41:17gates alone but not all of them because
41:22the not just the temptation but the
41:27things that can be accomplished by using
41:28field programmable gate arrays is just
41:32too great all right the thing that made
41:34the alto interesting at zero dark spark
41:36was the microcode the microcode allowed
41:39you to make an emulator for a desired
41:43virtual machine that would keep main
41:45memory busy and that meant that no
41:49custom made hardware could run any
41:51faster the thing was memory bound period
41:54and field programmable gate arrays
41:56actually allow some really interesting
42:01thoughts and as you read in the proposal
42:05the they're about a dozen principles in
42:10there I believe every one of you knows
42:13every single one of these maybe there's
42:15a couple that have escaped you but
42:17basically there's nothing here that is a
42:22particularly remarkable and in in our
42:26diagram here essentially this middle
42:31area is the area that we actually don't
42:35understand pretty well it also is the
42:37place where the most interesting ideas
42:41in the system if they are going to
42:43appear are going to appear and we know
42:47something about how to do this pretty
42:48well and we've done a lot of
42:50experimentation up towards the end user
42:52side I'm going to give you a couple of
42:54examples before we before we quit and
43:00have some chance for some questions so
43:06we did this system call etoys for
43:10children
43:12and while we were wanting to make it
43:16really simple and why we were doing it
43:19we thought well let's we can toss a few
43:25more things in there that the children
43:31may or may not find but we can try out
43:34some of our pet theories so basically
43:38one of the inspirations for etoys was
43:43thinking about what would a hypercard on
43:45steroids be like what if it were just
43:49had a really powerful simple object
43:52model and three it was Universal and
43:57okay it's a little car that the child
44:03might make and makes it into it into a
44:09thing and I can like I did before I can
44:17drag out some tiles here from the viewer
44:20on the on the car and just start the the
44:26car going now we saw that there was a
44:35little halo of stuff on that object in
44:39yeah here's another thing that's on a
44:44photograph and so I could possibly drag
44:50out something on it and here's another
44:54object which is the script but it's also
44:56got one of these things so so maybe i
45:03can write a script for it and i can come
45:11over here perhaps and grab onto the
45:17thing that's there like that and
45:21actually this whole thing i'm in this
45:23world
45:25gaiam in here I can look at it and so
45:33one of the ways of thinking about this
45:37system is instead of having a class
45:40object in a zillion this subclass only
45:43has one kind of object this is a
45:46universal object idea and the objects
45:48have different costumes and to give you
45:50a kind of a sense of this i'm going to
45:54suppress all the graphics yeah and this
45:59it helps you see that all of these
46:01things are actually the same this idea
46:03goes back a long ways because when we're
46:06doing the alto at xerox parc 12 thoughts
46:09we had as well to a naive user
46:12everything on the alto is just a smart
46:14rectangle windows are rectangles the
46:17characters or rectangles and there's
46:19some sort of function and magic behind
46:21them and that should allow you to make a
46:25different kind of object system than the
46:27one that similar thought about now of
46:29course I have to remember where i did
46:33this so i can change this thing back
46:36here okay so i'll just show you a few
46:43more examples the basic idea here what
46:46I'm trying to convince you is that the
46:48media part of this system is just
46:50endlessly recursive in fact one of the
46:56things that I forgot to do here is to
46:58show you how this presentation was made
47:04this is an idea we can never convince
47:06apple of but at xerox parc we had
47:15unlimited desktops and reason was that a
47:19desktop is a unit of work it's in a
47:22place where you go and you do a project
47:24that persists over days what happened
47:27when this interface went to apple and
47:30then to microsoft is that they forgot
47:32about the workflow aspects you have the
47:34silly thing of people building up
47:36windows and collapsing and building up
47:37windows
47:38but what you really want is something
47:39that sustains over time so if you look
47:41carefully up here you can see the
47:44presentation that you've seen so far and
47:46that is because I can have any number of
47:49sorting zuv these desktops right these
47:50desktops are like web pages I can hand
47:53them around except their full-blown
47:56media with objects they run in a browser
47:59because squeak can be a plug-in but I
48:02can also sort them so if I want to come
48:06back to my miracle happen slide next I
48:10can put put it in like that say ok and
48:14I'm going to call it the Intel November
48:1627 talk I can use these guys over and
48:19over again here and so if I go now to
48:25the next slide it's not the one that I
48:27had but it's the one that I just put in
48:29there see how simple this this is why
48:30PowerPoint is bad our point is a thing
48:34that essentially nooters any powerful
48:37thing that you have done it's unpowered
48:39point you do this wonderful thing and
48:42then you have to copy it into this week
48:44thing in order to show it but you can't
48:46show any of the dynamics right whereas
48:49what you really want to do is just work
48:51in the thing and some of them you're
48:52going to show on some of them you aren't
48:53going to show here's another idea and
48:58again using the children's programming
49:01and this is just a little salmon here
49:05following a brightness gradient you can
49:08read the thing fish is always going
49:10forward by five the last scene thing is
49:15greater than the lightness under the
49:18fish so I'm plotting what the fish is
49:20doing over here if it's yes keep on
49:23going straight it with no just just turn
49:27randomly and so the wonderful thing is
49:35that this fish will eventually find its
49:40way up there and every living thing has
49:44this little algorithm built into it and
49:49evolution
49:50has this algorithm built into it this is
49:53what evolution actually does doesn't do
49:55anything more than this then the fun
49:58thing is so having done such a simple
50:01little hill climbing thing then if you
50:04have a particle system that is
50:06programmed the same way you can do
50:09something much more interesting here but
50:11almost as easily so these are a bunch of
50:13ants and this field that the answer on
50:17is actually ten thousand little patch
50:21computers that are handling the
50:24diffusing of the pheromones and the
50:27evaporation of them right and so even on
50:31this little laptop that I have we can do
50:33a million particles at ten frames a
50:36second okay from these tiny simple
50:39little programs I think most of you are
50:41aware that Tech is an example of a
50:48system that is able to do a very very
50:51good job of solving certain kinds of
50:54constraints for dealing with these and
50:56so this metaphor is spoken about in this
50:59paper as a particle field programming so
51:04just a zillion things like sending
51:06messages in an object-oriented language
51:08is one of these things you can think of
51:10this as a tuple space for Linda if you
51:12want right there's just a zillion things
51:15where you want to be able to have an
51:18environment and one of the differences
51:21between this children's environment and
51:24say squeak or Java is that the objects
51:32in here can all see each other because
51:35they're in the same and they're actually
51:36situated we don't use lists sharing so
51:39I'll talk uses list sharing but the et
51:41toi system doesn't so everybody knows
51:44where they are okay so here's an example
51:52of particle field programming so here's
51:57a little here's a little text paragraph
52:02I'm just getting it to justify itself
52:04everybody has done this program but
52:10maybe not this way this is the entire
52:12text editor shown on the screen here and
52:15I'll reveal what's going on here by
52:18letting these guys loose okay so each
52:20one of these is a little guy one of
52:24those ants and so the formatting I tell
52:31them to just wander back you can see
52:33them following the leader I tell them
52:39the hot back then they they stop I tell
52:43them the snapback they snap back and now
52:47they do that thing in between the same
52:49time in this system the process
52:54switching and the message passing have
52:56are the same speed all right so it
52:59actually doesn't cost you to have
53:01200,000 processes in this system you
53:05could just use them and all of a sudden
53:08you wind up with these extremely simple
53:11like this is all you need to do the
53:13formatting and this is all you need to
53:17do to do the selection so if I draw
53:22through each of these guys is actually
53:26looking out to sea where the thing is in
53:29the editing for doing it
53:41so let's see this is a japanese keyboard
53:44so i have to be careful here maybe this
53:47one nope that one okay the well the
54:05spell check is usually done by having
54:08lots of examples right I don't know of
54:12any algorithm that understands English
54:14intrinsically so I'm not sure what your
54:16question is but sure you you mean the
54:20thing to check to see whether you're at
54:22some interesting Hamming distance from
54:25the thing I don't know because we
54:26haven't done it so I'm just taking Don
54:29Knuth escape route here but it better be
54:33because the system in order to fit into
54:36twenty thousand lines all of this stuff
54:38has to be done in this kind of model t
54:46co because the basic idea here is that
54:49you should be able to give you a little
54:51exam so here's a simple animation
54:55program and the kids just made different
55:00examples in both this two liner and the
55:03movies are essentially animations so
55:07here's the movie for dropping a ball in
55:11this gravity thing and that is exactly
55:16the same code at the end user level and
55:23this movie is the
55:44this movie has exactly the same two
55:47liner but there are things in between
55:50this thing is actually fetching the
55:52frames off the disk it's doing an MPEG
55:56decoding of them and so forth but the
55:59master code for what the movie is and
56:01what the user interface is exactly is
56:05exactly the same and I won't okay and
56:15I've already showed showed you this but
56:18this is kind of that ants thing done as
56:21desktop publishing or maybe not
56:47runs around and
57:05so now it has this is a harder task
57:07because it has to do the anti-aliasing
57:08on the text and of course the kids
57:13system wasn't actually made to do this
57:17but now let's just take maybe one
57:21example from down here as may be the
57:27last actual example here's one that I
57:30already mentioned is that you should be
57:33able to pull it replace any wiring
57:35system with an ethernet and I believe
57:38you should be able to replace the
57:40hundreds of different ways that messages
57:42are sent to each other in operating
57:44systems by also something like that that
57:47is you should be ever replace an
57:49operating system with an Internet
57:51internally and another thing that is
57:57kind of annoying it goes all the way
57:59back to tony hoare and Dykstra is the
58:05idea of using semaphores and monitors
58:08and stuff like that and a problem with
58:10those is that they cause various kinds
58:13of bottlenecks and lock up and at the
58:16very same time when that stuff was being
58:19done the similar guys and John McCarthy
58:22separately we're doing a much better way
58:24of thinking about this stuff and that is
58:26to run your computations in pseudo time
58:29when you run in pseudo time there are no
58:32race conditions that are not detectable
58:35because you're basically labeling every
58:38state and you're essentially only
58:40advancing the pseudo time clock when
58:42you're not doing any computation I will
58:45not go too much further but a very
58:49interesting example of this is dave
58:51reads thesis read is the guy who's the
58:54slash in tcp/ip he was a guy who
58:58suggested separating them in his thesis
59:01was about how to distribute computations
59:04over the internet right so the idea is
59:09they're just so many examples where you
59:13have to essentially clone an object that
59:16you want to remain logically
59:19so you essentially have the dynamic
59:21version of atomic transactions on
59:24distributed databases so if you've got
59:26objects and so reads thesis was one of
59:30the first schemes that allows you to do
59:33that kind of coordination safely and it
59:36actually works well enough so that you
59:39can do something that appeals appears to
59:42be real time to the end users and I just
59:48refer you to that we have done two
59:50versions of this and if you're
59:52interested you can go look at croquet on
59:55the on the internet so this is a
59:59essentially a model of computation where
60:05time is actually part of the model it's
60:08not something that happens to you from
60:10the outside it's something that you were
60:12actually controlling ok so the this is
60:16ian p amardas work and i suggest having
60:20him invited if you're interested in this
60:23stuff this is pretty neat I think if
60:25this is good old time computer science
60:28because it's something that was big in
60:30the late 60s which was how can you do
60:32extensible languages from tiny kernels
60:34and still have them run very well so we
60:39can describe the system as little golden
60:42box and golden this some of the people
60:47in this room I'm sure have done things
60:49kind of like it so for example one of
60:54these pages of the couple hundred lines
60:59of code here looks kind of like a BNF
61:02and it has patterns that are
61:07translatable and so 150 lines or so into
61:14the golden box makes a JavaScript or
61:18Python or prologue or pretty much any of
61:21the languages today the javascript one
61:23runs about 20 times as fast as the one
61:26in the browser that's because the golden
61:28box generates machine code for a wide
61:31variety of platforms
61:32interpreters okay and so this is a key
61:35part of this thing is you'd like to have
61:38something it has all of these wonderful
61:40self reflective properties but is still
61:43able to compile past code and then the
61:48other trick that the golden box can do
61:50is is a thousand lines of code put into
61:52the golden box makes another golden box
61:54so in fact in a week you can experiment
61:58with three or four programming languages
62:00change the golden box and the next week
62:04you have a different golden box you have
62:05a different set of experiments we've
62:07been doing this starting in the starting
62:10in the summer and as Vic Jagger might
62:12say it's only math and science basically
62:15this is something that many of the
62:18graduate students I've run into just
62:21have never had the experience of
62:23bootstrapping from scratch because
62:26they're supposed to learn Java they're
62:30supposed to learn all the bending you
62:31know you think they were going to some
62:33sort of trade school rather than
62:35learning how to do real computing
62:39actually an interesting example of that
62:47just show you so this is about three
62:54hundred lines of code so we're going to
63:01make a java script from scratch and then
63:03give it a Tetris program so it makes
63:12this little engine
63:23no why jack graduate students are a lot
63:26faster than i am but you get the idea so
63:31that's like about 350 lines of code to
63:35do that and part of the experiments down
63:38here just to do lots of these to try and
63:42understand what the what the best
63:43balance because we we actually can't
63:45spend a lot of time and a lot of lines
63:48of code down at the sand and be
63:49successful in this project so the next
63:52project in the golden box is to do
63:54tcp/ip does it might sound kind of weird
63:57but if you think of tcp/ip is kind of
63:59parsing and pattern matching problem if
64:01you were to look at it from that like
64:04you can think of this kind of a pipeline
64:05process with non determinism in there an
64:09interesting way and so we think it can
64:12be done in around two hundred lines of
64:13code actually run fast enough to fulfill
64:17what tcp/ip has to do on the on the
64:19network and that would be a very good
64:21test of some of these ideas okay so so
64:31the approach here is to say that there's
64:34there's really two things that have
64:36gotten smashed into one in computing and
64:38actually there's a psychology that has
64:42arisen because of it so my first machine
64:45in 1961 was an 8k by 14 01 and in those
64:53days the number one thing that a
64:56programmer had to be able to do was to
64:58cope and I would claim that over those
65:0246 years 45 years but that is pretty
65:06much stayed constant that a large part
65:09of what it means to be a programmer is
65:11to be able to cope with what's there
65:12because kind of that's what they're
65:14paying you for palm is that's not what
65:15they're paying graduate students for
65:17right graduate students need to say no
65:21I'm not going to cope with this this is
65:22I'm going to do this this and this
65:25but in fact we hire people who have a
65:29huge background in programming and so
65:33they're willing to show how much pain
65:34they
65:35take when you give them some system and
65:38they tend to just add on to that system
65:40instead of saying this is that's a
65:43huge problem so what one of the things
65:46that this is one of the most important
65:52parts of the system is two completely
65:53separate out the meanings and the
65:58meanings are not going to be expressed
65:59in terms of unit tests or just
66:02predicates the meanings have to be
66:04expressed in terms of a runnable code
66:06sufficient enough to get the entire
66:09system running but the meanings are
66:12going to be completely separated from
66:14the optimizations completely so that any
66:19set of optimizations can be turned off
66:21while the system is running it'll still
66:22run so Model T here I grew up with Model
66:31T on a farm in Massachusetts reason they
66:35were still there's you could not really
66:36destroy a Model T we would have to
66:40grenade it or something because it was
66:43made out of cast iron and the farms all
66:46had little black smithy things and only
66:50had about 350 main parts and about a
66:52thousand screws and other things and
66:55basically a 12 or 13 year old could take
66:57it apart on the floor of a barn do
67:00something to and put it back together
67:01over a weekend and yet it was a
67:04completely real automobile so it's just
67:08you know which people had that
67:10experience and the reason i put this
67:12dime here is to remind me to say that
67:17the spark gap on the Model T was set by
67:20the thickness of a dime when they asked
67:23Henry Ford why did he do that he says
67:25well people lose gauges but they usually
67:27have a dime on imagine any automobile
67:31today being done that way like you have
67:36to put on a radiation suit to open the
67:38hood of them so the so that the premise
67:42here is that the actual meaning the
67:47meaning
67:47symantec separated out from the
67:49pragmatics is actually tiny that's what
67:54my intuition says there's hardly any
67:56content in these millions of lines of
67:59code and that combined with extremely
68:04binding right so so if you're working in
68:11an early binding system you're doing
68:13something but you're going to have a
68:14hard time doing all the experiments that
68:16you need and you're going to have a hard
68:17time taking the important things you've
68:19learned when you've gotten this far and
68:22being able to put them back in here so
68:24this leads to sort of the first and only
68:27system syndrome and then people feed
68:29that system rather than throwing it away
68:31and I think it's vital given that we
68:34don't understand how to do computer
68:36science or software engineering to make
68:40everything Lake bound okay just a couple
68:44okay so now the other thing that's
68:48exciting and it's happening right here
68:50at Berkeley and some of you may be
68:51familiar with Dave Patterson's ramp
68:55project here anybody so dave is a very
68:59cool guy and Chuck Thakur here is an
69:03even cooler guy in a way because he was
69:06responsible for all of the hardware
69:08architectures that we had at xerox parc
69:10it would just make these machines about
69:13every 18 months he would make a new
69:15machine for us and we had a little
69:18manufacturing facility so that 2,000 of
69:21these alphas were actually made by us in
69:24the 70s so we could hand them out to
69:27everybody and chuck is in the middle of
69:30taking the next field programmable gate
69:35array technology and making an alto for
69:382007 by in alto being defined as two
69:43cubic feet of the fastest hardware on
69:45the planet and it gives you two things
69:49it gives you the ability to do a lot of
69:51things without having to optimize or it
69:55gives you the chance to actually do a
69:57program as it would be done 10 years in
69:59the future
70:01I then you would do some optimization so
70:03both of those things obtained at Xerox
70:05PARC and that this machine was Italy
70:10more responsible I think for our success
70:12than most of our good ideas the fact
70:16that we had that thing it just
70:18completely changed the dynamic of what
70:20we were willing to try and trying in
70:24both directions we got a lot of insights
70:28both ways so here's the sermon here is
70:37to that we have to be conscious that our
70:41nervous system is internalizing what's
70:44constant in our environment as normal
70:46and as explorative scientists and
70:49designers we cannot tolerate that so the
70:52number one thing is just to be aware of
70:54whatever you think is normal is probably
70:56bad for you by just getting sensitized
71:00to it because it's the basic attitude in
71:02science common sense dominated for
71:05200,000 years 400 years ago people
71:08started finding ways around what was
71:10wrong with human common sense and the
71:13same thing is in computing today is that
71:15the common sense of most of the people
71:17who are coping with all of the stuff
71:20that's out there today is completely
71:22blinding them to what the actual
71:25possibilities are I think I'll just it
71:33and the these are a couple of statistics
71:36about this system done dynamically so
71:40I'm just asking it how many what sizes
71:47all the code in the system of this thing
71:49that I've shown you it's about 3.5
71:51megabytes and how many methods are there
72:05and about 60,000 which is huge and but
72:13the average number of bytes per method
72:16is only 59 so that's not bad there are
72:19tiny little things 230,000 lines of code
72:22in the system and the total number of
72:24objects in here because this is a
72:26dynamic system I can actually ask it to
72:28count all the objects in the system
72:30including all the integers in it right
72:32now so that's always an interesting
72:34number so just just a little less than 5
72:40million dynamic objects in the system
72:44going on with the same architecture
72:46going all the way down to where there
72:47isn't an operating system but where what
72:49an operating system does so this is kind
72:52of a sloppy example that you can do
72:55something interesting and a few hundred
72:57thousand lines of code that covers large
72:59parts of what we think of this personal
73:01computing and I think we can go a factor
73:03of 10 smaller and invite any of you who
73:07are interested to contact me and we have
73:12money for internships and faculty
73:15consulting etc etc and it's going to
73:19take a fair number of people who are
73:24interested in solving these difficult
73:26problems to make the results of this
73:28project interesting thank you very much
73:37any questions is preposterous let's get
73:44past that yes well that's sure one
73:55person with a factor of 10 more IQ than
73:58I have absolutely well we have a
74:01graduate student it has a factor of five
74:03more IQ than I have so yeah two we just
74:07really need one more graduate student
74:10exactly yes
74:21well it's not exist basically the
74:27although Google is I've been talking to
74:30Peter Norvig over there off and on
74:33trying to get them interested we all
74:35need funding from them thank goodness
74:37but I've been trying to get them
74:40interested in some of this higher level
74:43stuff most of the stuff that they're
74:46doing over there is is trying to make
74:50things make the executable smaller but
74:54I'm not aware of the trying for really
74:58high levels of expression but maybe
75:02maybe you know something i I don't I go
75:07over there every once and every once in
75:09a while every couple of months or so and
75:10talk talking about what they're doing is
75:14interesting that if you look at the you
75:17know the web programming that the the
75:22actual programming languages are except
75:26for the fact that they lack depth are
75:28rather you know similar to any dynamic
75:32language the scripting language is like
75:34like javascript in and Python but what
75:37what is lacking in their terribly is the
75:41environment in the browser it's the do
75:44em which is just really a god-awful mess
75:47it doesn't have any power and the
75:50JavaScript which you can get to is not
75:53strong enough to allow you to to supply
75:55your own primitives to that like you
75:58should be able to override stuff that's
76:01in the Dom like if you don't like the
76:03way their canvas those you should be
76:05able to take JavaScript running 50 times
76:09faster and writer a better canvas in
76:12there but you can't because they just
76:15aren't the scripting languages or
76:17thought of as add-ons on to some thing
76:20that was originally written in C++ or
76:22some other kind of thing so the so the
76:25the architecture is actually walled off
76:27and it reminds me of like experiments
76:30and we
76:30do active chemistry you know where
76:31there's that dangerous stuff behind the
76:34lead wall and you're over here with the
76:37waldos pouring thanks whereas if you
76:42look at if you take something that isn't
76:44reference to our own work in the past
76:46but you take something that we looked on
76:49with some admiration the list machine
76:51that the MIT AI lab did and then there's
76:55a list machine company that was an
76:57example of a higher level architecture
76:58done from the bottom up to the top or
77:02top down to the bottom so the hardware
77:05was there to run the programming
77:09language efficiently and so that every
77:11single part of that system could be
77:14criticized by some programmer and you
77:17could override it was something of your
77:20own I mean even similar habit simula had
77:23this idea of virtual procedures and even
77:26though it was a an early bound language
77:29a virtual procedure if you mark some
77:32procedure in a superclass virtual and
77:35you subclass that and supplied a
77:38procedure with that name it would
77:40actually also be called up in the
77:44superclass so you could have a mediocre
77:47sort program up in the superclass you
77:49could write a better sort program and
77:51the whole system would use that better
77:54sort program not just your sub class and
77:58that's done dynamically in the small
78:00talks but basically all of those things
78:03are saying that in the end you need to
78:08be able to have your cake and eat it too
78:09you have to have perfect safety and one
78:15of the ways of doing that is to notice
78:17how difficult it is to really crash the
78:19internet right it's only with some
78:22computer program that the internet can't
78:25really be crashed you can slow it down
78:28but the only crashes that ever happen
78:32are some bad piece of code in somebody
78:35else's operating system deciding to
78:37execute some perfectly innocent message
78:39they were sent right so if you think
78:42about the internet it
78:43is a pure messaging environment that
78:45does not have in it the the ability to
78:50crash itself that was deliberate by
78:53those guys see you but then you have
78:56this possibility once you have that then
78:57you can actually safely override
79:01anything with something better so I
79:05don't want to criticize the way
79:08programming is done on the net but I'm I
79:11wish they would do it a different way
79:14basically it's like a pop culture trying
79:18to reinvent Bach and it's just hard to
79:21do it that way because Bach was one of
79:25the time you know you're better off
79:27reading about Bach and Newton rather
79:28than trying to recapitulate with what
79:31they did I think that's the big problem
79:34there yes yeah so what you are saying
79:42about starting from the Dom rumail
79:46you're already multiple inconsistence
79:51available and all that stuff do you meet
79:54because in the end the programmers
79:56succumbed to the temptation of using the
79:58library and using this and using that
80:01the other thing and it wasn't supposed
80:04to happen with squeak I actually got
80:06blood oaths from some of the systems
80:10people who we worked on with that thing
80:13but in the end when the hit the fan
80:16they just wouldn't get rid of it because
80:18it was too useful and that's why I gave
80:22that little funny little demo because i
80:24haven't actually run a demo from a
80:26command-line interface since like the
80:28early 70s but yeah we decide and that's
80:32why E&P marta stuff is important just
80:35for morale and we just decided that even
80:39though it's going to be inconvenient
80:41psychologically it's going to be
80:43critical for us to believe that we don't
80:46have to make a big scaffolding and small
80:48talk and then promise to ourselves that
80:50we're going to get rid of it later and
80:52we're absolutely going to build the
80:54stuff I'm the raw bits
80:56and Ian stuff generates machine code and
80:59that's the machine code we're going to
81:01live with we go on there and of course
81:04we have to you know right away we have
81:06to make some sort of interactive
81:08development environment or because we
81:11absolutely don't want to be pushing text
81:14files into the thing but as soon as we
81:17do that we've actually started down the
81:20path way of making commitments to early
81:24by interactive development environments
81:27are actually a fair amount of work and
81:29you need them early so once you've done
81:32that all of a sudden you've set the tone
81:35of what what one part of the
81:37architecture is going to be and then try
81:39and get any programmer to give up that
81:41thing so a lot of the logistics on this
81:44thing are basically laying the plans
81:46that I draw our plans that for the first
81:51year 2007 we basically are going to have
81:54five or six parallel strands of just
81:57doing X throwaway experiments because we
82:03think we understand that how the top end
82:05works in this thing that's the thing we
82:09understand the most of the single object
82:11model at the sort of at the end user
82:13space and how you get everything out of
82:15it and the getting the bottom to a place
82:20where we can get into that yellow
82:21ellipse without having made too many
82:25commitments already at the top is
82:28basically the trick on this project we
82:29have to get ourselves into a place where
82:31where we can do serious throwaway
82:34experiments with very high level
82:36constructs that are actually going to
82:37take a fair amount of work to do so it's
82:41kind of it and basically when people
82:42join the project I explain the deal here
82:46this is not this is not just a technical
82:49project it's actually dealing with
82:50psychological difficulties that we all
82:52have as computer scientists and
82:54designers and you know thank goodness an
82:58NSF gave us an incredible gift here
83:00because this is the first funding I've
83:02gotten since really since 1990 that
83:07didn't have a lot of side conditions on
83:09they just really did fund this thing and
83:12I found another million a year for five
83:13years to make this the size project it
83:16can be and there's just nobody waiting
83:18for us to get done on this thing right
83:21so it's like me it's like Xerox PARC now
83:25except we don't have girl anthem down
83:27the hall to tell us why we're doing it
83:29all wrong right and I miss him terribly
83:34because no Butler had an interesting way
83:38of being right in a most important way
83:42you can be even when we went against him
83:44the fact that he was critical in the
83:48particular way he was helped us thinking
83:50about why we really didn't want to do it
83:52that way because he's just incredibly
83:55sharp so yeah so it's an interesting
83:59it's an interesting deal of trying to
84:06find it it in fact I've been talking to
84:10the UCLA computer science department
84:12where I'm get I'm on the faculty there
84:14but they have this paper mill for both
84:18graduate students and professors it is
84:20just outrageous outrageous nobody can do
84:25any real work because they have to write
84:27so many papers and when I went to
84:30graduate school we basically only have
84:32to do your PhD thesis and it was
84:33supposed to be good but that they didn't
84:37waste anybody's effort with little
84:39things along along the way because they
84:43just divert focus so yeah so we're
84:48getting actually a lot of cooperation
84:50the computer science department is
84:51cooperating we have one of the
84:53professors roped in isn't it one of the
84:57interesting ideas in this system is
85:00typing as big today but of course you
85:03don't what you need typing for something
85:06completely different in a system like
85:08this and most of the typing results are
85:11not at all interesting but there's a
85:13thing that's like a supertype which is
85:17to think of an object or a method
85:23being able to characterize what that
85:25object or method needs in its
85:26environment in order to actually run and
85:30so one of the things that's proposed in
85:32there is the idea that is there worrying
85:35about typing on variables we should be
85:37worrying about typing meaning and in
85:40fact any object we really care about we
85:43should write a stub environment that
85:45allows the object to run just in that
85:49environment stand a lot right and you
85:52can think of that as being a simulation
85:54of its type pneus even if you don't know
85:57what it is logically and when you take
86:01that object and put it in a dynamic
86:03environment and it may find some of the
86:06things that needs in environment but
86:07these stubs also supplied the defaults
86:09now the may or may not be there all
86:13right so this is a late binding idea for
86:16trying to guarantee that the meaningful
86:22stuff that you've said over here stays
86:25meaningful over here which is kind of
86:26what typing is a surprise just that it's
86:29not that interesting to have it be an
86:31integer or a string and a variable that
86:35justice then doesn't cut it as far as
86:38what you're really trying to deal with
86:40but that is a really interesting
86:42theoretical problem and but it's also an
86:47interesting practical one of how can you
86:49make it easy for the program so you
86:50should be able to use something like
86:51type inference to try and start building
86:54this external model you should be able
86:56to present it in a user interface to
86:58help the programmer but maybe sort of
87:00just maybe there's a function out there
87:02but maybe you just give it some typical
87:03values to start off with so now it
87:06starts looking like an AI program now
87:09like one of Doug Linnets automated
87:12mathematician programs are you risk oh
87:15that goes around gathering evidence
87:16before it tries to make a picture of the
87:19function all right so that's one of the
87:22dozen things in there that we think
87:24really needs to be another one is set of
87:28support so AI has this idea of truth
87:31maintenance but no system i know of
87:34actually has truth maintenance up
87:36method same idea right some systems
87:41programmer changes some sis something
87:45over here and all of a sudden your
87:47method which was running perfectly Wells
87:50not running so well any more even though
87:53it past all the unit tests over here all
87:56right that just can't be allowed to do
87:59it but nobody knows how to deal with
88:00that problem it's clearly part of what
88:02software engineering has to be able to
88:05to deal with that's akin to being able
88:10being able to have some sensitivity to
88:13the signal levels that are actually
88:16being sent you in an icy there's a lot
88:20of interesting I always thought we find
88:22it this project very interesting and we
88:25didn't expect to get funded and we just
88:28actually got our first infusion of money
88:29a few days ago from them so I think it's
88:33real yes yeah we'll go the golden but
88:48I've tried a lot of different ways of
88:54explain but using what the if you could
88:58golden box actually has two models that
89:03are intertwined in each other and the
89:09simplest way of thinking about it is you
89:11can go back to that one half page wisp
89:15in itself so you can't run that right
89:20because there's no there's no energy
89:22coming yet so it's just met a circular
89:25and so to run it you have to actually
89:28sneak in some computation somewhere and
89:33one of the things you can do there is a
89:35really good exercise to do it is to try
89:37and figure out how you could use
89:38something very much like what McCarthy
89:41wrote but instead of
89:44because describing an interpreter what
89:46the thing does is to admit machine code
89:48and some of the early list compilers
89:51back in the 60s did just that because
89:54they realize oh yeah this thing this
89:57thing is chucking it along there and the
90:00main difference between compilation and
90:03interpretation is that when I'm
90:06compiling I have to generate code that
90:11will make that result that I would
90:13expect to get from the interpreter so if
90:16you do that really careful you wind up
90:18with this thing that is essentially a
90:20compiler for things that are of the
90:22power of Lisp but are about the size of
90:25that half page of code but they actually
90:27generate machine code that's just a
90:30revelation because it's right there and
90:33you turn the crank on it and it starts
90:36making new versions of itself right
90:38because it's written in itself so so the
90:41golden box is you know 30 years of
90:45sophistication on top of that for
90:49methods and then kind of orthogonal II
90:52it has a metamodel for what objects me
90:55and by the way that paper that system is
90:59called Albert in here and there is a
91:04paper online that you can read the tries
91:06to explain just what this thing does so
91:12the so what does that slide man is that
91:16the golden box is something it will take
91:19a description of some correspondence of
91:26some form and assign meanings to it and
91:30then it will compile code from that
91:33that's what the golden box does and the
91:35size of the golden box itself is only a
91:39thousand lines of code and it's in
91:42exactly the same form as what you put in
91:45there to get JavaScript the javascript
91:46is only like 150 lines of code golden
91:49box has many other things and it uses
91:51the pattern matcher for also doing
91:53register allocation and stuff like that
91:55it's pretty sick
91:56instigate it but still small so it's
91:59basically a thousand lines but generates
92:02a complete kernel that can generate
92:05other things out of it as a very 60s
92:09kind of think the first small talk at
92:11Xerox PARC was done very much like that
92:14it smelled like 72 but a difference
92:19between then and now is that this thing
92:24has just had a lot more thought put into
92:26it then we what we do how to do back
92:28then and the sky E&P amata got his PhD
92:32at manchester is a bit of a genius i
92:35think so the golden box is actually
92:39philosophically interesting also it's
92:43not it's not a secret I mean it's just
92:44their papers being written about it but
92:49has this interesting thing that be
92:50because the first because it doesn't
92:54take much to specify a language you can
92:57do it kind of in an afternoon and do a
92:59bunch of experiments you can do a couple
93:01of languages every couple of days and
93:03try out various kinds of schemes on the
93:06thing and that usually tells you
93:07something about what the golden box is
93:09or is not doing for you but then you can
93:12go and modify those thousand lines and
93:15shove it through the golden box you get
93:16a new golden box and so you just you
93:20know at some point you don't take such a
93:24draconian measure on the thing but for
93:28experiments it's wonderful because it's
93:30actual actually think about and we have
93:32the golden box itself up on the wall we
93:35print it out and put it up on a wall so
93:38we can just look at it cuz that's
93:41whatever 50 into a thousand is like 20
93:44pages of code or so so it's a kind of
93:48play table kind of thing it has a
93:52garbage collector in that you know it
93:53has a bunch of different things in there
93:57that allow it to make a little
93:58environment that's just a better one
94:01than we did for small talk 72 butts
94:06the biggest program the alto could
94:08handle when it was first done was 20
94:12pages of small talk and and we were
94:20doing you know complete windowing
94:22systems and modeless editors and
94:25everything else on the thing in part
94:29because it can only hold 20 pages of
94:31code so we have to think about what the
94:35meaning of that those 20 pages could
94:38actually be the part of it is just
94:41assess it it's like the hundred-dollar
94:43laptop I'm going to try and get some for
94:46both UCLA and berkeley if I can get them
94:48away from Nicholas but all of the ones
94:53right now are slated for the third world
94:54but it is just a great machine to give
94:57to a graduate student because it's about
94:59a factor of five to ten slower than
95:03today's laptops and yet it's a factor of
95:0920 or 30 times faster than the Alpha was
95:14writing this 100 bucks and you know any
95:17computer person should be able to do
95:18something on this machine that so and it
95:22just changes the scale of what you're
95:26going to try and do and basically I
95:28think for good computer people it just
95:30immediately gets them thinking higher
95:32level thoughts because they know
95:36instinctively that this thing that's
95:38this big is really this big if they
95:40could just figure out what it is
95:42mathematically thank you very much thank
95:46you
