### Most things are obsolete

1. This is exactly what Alan Kay was saying for a long time (probably since he saw how limited the adoption of Smalltalk was after it came out of PARC), pointing out that top languages in use today, and many of the those less used, haven't got passed Simula which was one of the great languages of the 60s. It seems like this can be noticed only by people old enough to experience languages of the 60s and lucky (and smart) enough to experience advances which followed in the 70s and maybe 80s, but have never reached mainstream.
2. Since almost all companies are writing millions of lines of mostly incomprehensible code, this is probably greatest confirmation that languages in general use today simply do not scale. It is also amazing to look back at the greatest artifacts of the 60s and 70s and see with how tiny amount of code they were implemented on machines with wastly less resources. For example, as we can hear from Alan Kay, personal computing as done by his group at PARC was done in only about 10k lines of code. Also Howard Shrobe wrote in one of his [papers](https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/30447/MIT-CSAIL-TR-2004-006.pdf?sequence=2) that Genera, "operating system" (it was not [traditionally](http://lispm.de/genera-concepts) structured) on Symbolics Lisp Machines was implemented in only about 1 million LOC. So, with better architecture (both hardware and software) one can do a lot with much less material, or as Alan Kay said so many times - architecture dominates material.
