Note: This document includes edited transcript of Sussman's talk with associated slided plus my comments and questions. Document is organized in a way that each section contains Sussman's claims in bold, followed by associated slid and possibly my comments and questions.

Opening remark: We are in a real trouble and have not the foggiest idea how to compute very well. There might some glimmer of hope on the horizon, in number of different direction, some of which I might point out.

### Most things are obsolete

**Most things we are talking about, even here are obsolete. As I said to somebody at the yesterday's Haskell sessions: this is the most advanced of the obsolete languages.**

My comments/questions:
1. This is exactly what Alan Kay was saying for a long time, pointing out that top languages in use today haven't got passed Simula which was one of the great languages of the 60s.
2. Since almost all companies are writing millions of lines of mostly incomprehensible code, this is probably greatest confirmation that languages in general use today simply do not scale. It is also amazing to look back at the greatest artifacts of the 60s and 70s and see with how tiny amount of code they were implemented on machines with wastly less resources. For example, as we can hear from Alan Kay, personal computing as done by his group at PARC was done in only about 10k lines of code. Also Howard Shrobe wrote in one of his papers that OS on Lisp Machines (done by Symbolics) was implemented in only about 1 million LOC written in maybe Common Lisp/CLOS (or some other Lisp variant - Lisp Machine Lisp?). So, with better architecture (both hardware and software) one can do a lot with much less material, or as Alan Kay said so many times - architecture dominates material.
