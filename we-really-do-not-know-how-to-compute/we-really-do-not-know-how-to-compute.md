Opening remark: We are in a real trouble and have not the foggiest idea how to compute very well. There might some glimmer of hope on the horizon, in number of different direction, some of which I might point out.

### Most things are obsolete

**Most things we are talking about, even here are obsolete. As I said to somebody at the yesterday's Haskell sessions: this is the most advanced of the obsolete languages.**

My comments/questions:
1. This is exactly what Alan Kay was saying for a long time, pointing out that top languages in use today haven't got passed Simula which was one of the great languages of the 60s.
2. Since almost all companies are writing millions of lines of mostly incomprehensible code, this is probably greatest confirmation that languages in general use today simply do not scale. It is also amazing to look back at the greatest artifacts of the 60s and 70s and see with how tiny amount of code they were implemented on machines with wastly less resources. For example, as we can hear from Alan Kay, personal computing as done by his group at PARC was done in only about 10k lines of code. Also Howard Shrobe wrote in one of his papers that OS on Lisp Machines (done by Symbolics) was implemented in only about 1 million LOC written in maybe Common Lisp/CLOS (or some other Lisp variant - Lisp Machine Lisp?). So, with better architecture (both hardware and software) one can do a lot with much less material, or as Alan Kay said so many times - architecture dominates material.

### [Kanizsaâ€™s Triangle Illusion](slides/page_2.pdf)

**You now see the triange that is not there. What did you do? I took only 100 or maybe 200 ms, or few tens of neuron times. I do not care how parallel the machine is. I do have the foggiest idea how to write a program that organizes complex process like that in the latency of about 30 or 40 steps. That is the example of something we do not understand how to do.  

### Human genome

**And more serious than that, human genome is about a GB. That is instructions for making you from a cell. You are pretty complicated machine. A GB is the same size as the source code appropriate for making say Microsoft Windows. It is not much bigger or smaller, it is somethig like that. It has all the possible things it can do, all possible drivers which might be relevant. It is probably of that size. It is not much bigger, not 3 orders of magnitude bigger. A GB is not that big, but what is interesting is that with the small change you make a cowens? out of the person, so it is flexible too. So we have enourmously flexible language there that we do not have the foggiest idea what it is like. I am not talking about DNA. DNA is like gates, or something. What I am interested is the higher level language that is necessary to do things like that and we certainly do not know how to do that.**

### Salamander example

**Biologists do nasty experiments on animals. Suppose you took a salamander. Salamander can regrow it's limbs if you cut them off. So all these biologists do nasty experiments. They cut salamander's arm off between the shoulder and elbow, and between the elbow and the hand, flip around that segment and resow it back on. What do you think you get? You get 3 elbows. It grows for the fact that the wrong thing is connected to the wrong thing. That's pretty weird. But that is a clue to something that we should be thinking about. How do you talk about how to make a bazillion - human is 10^12 cells, salamander is probably 10^11 or 10^10 - but the fact is how do you make something big like that grow itself? Little neighbours talking to each other and they say: I am supposed to connect to something like this but it ain't there, so we will make some of that. That is sort of amazing kind of process that is going to be necessary if we want to approach the future in our computing because it is almost impossible to setup the situation in which we know everything that is going to happen in the future.**

### [IBM 650](slides/page_3.pdf)

**Let me go into the past a bit. When I started computing in 1961 I was computing on the IBM 650 at the Columbia State University. That machine costs half a million bucks. It had 2000 words of 10 decimal digits each of memory on a drum that rotated so that access time was 12.5 ms. 10 ms cycle time. Total amount of memory was probably about 10 KB. For the price of that machine now I can buy 50 thousand PCs each with a GB of RAM (that is 10^4 times as much) and million times faster. So one of the things that has been happening over the years (I am not trying to worry about Moore's law or anything like that). What I am worried about is that all our intuitions from being programmers have come from a time of assuming a kind of scarcity, a world in which computation is somehow expensive, where memory is somehow expensive, where we have to optimize it. Well, there some applications like that, but the answer is that most applications are not like that at all. Right now, memory is free, computing is free.
